## Challenge 18 - Tableau
'[Link to Tableau Citibike](https://public.tableau.com/views/Citibike_17085489044310/CitiBikeDec2021-2023?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)'

## Data
I obtained data from the '[New York Citibike](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)' website for December in 2021, 2022, and 2023.

## Analysis
Over the course of three years, there was a noticeable increase in the number of bike stations available. This growth is evident when examining the data month by month. Interestingly, there's a decrease in rides as the holidays approach, indicating a shift in people's travel patterns during festive periods. The majority of rides occur during typical work hours, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., highlighting the impact of daily routines on bike usage.

A significant trend observed in the data is the consistent rise in classic bike ridership each year, contrasted by a sharp decline in docked bike usage, which completely disappears between 2021 and 2023.

The analysis also presents the top Starting and Ending Stations, ranked by ridership, along with population density statistics. Stations with ride counts exceeding 15,000 are highlighted, illustrating the variation between Starting and Ending Stations in terms of popularity and usage.
